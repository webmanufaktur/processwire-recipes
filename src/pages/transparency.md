## #buildinpublic

> **What does it mean to "Build in Public"?**<br />Unlike a lot of startup jargon that is confusing to the uninitiated, building in public is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. When a startup builds a product or service in public, they allow people to see their building process from the start.

To be clear:
**I don't see this as a startup of any kind.**

I like the philosophy behind all the amazing **#buildinpublic** projects you can find on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23buildinpublic) for example; or elsewhere.

There are so many developers, designers, and people around that just want to start something -- so I thought I go with it. Even if I totally fail in terms of _making money_. ðŸ˜‚

This isn't the purpose of this project at all.

This project is way more for me than _just making money_.

_Making money_ wasn't even a thought when I started it.

It's more like **reviving a foundation** for new and upcoming ProcessWire enthusiasts and a nice bookmark for myself to find my preferred shortcuts in some cases.

Yet the domain is quite expensive in the 2nd year so I might have to make at least some money with it. Otherwise I might have to cancel one or another ProModule -- no, just kidding. ðŸ˜‰

## Will there be ads?

There is a whole page about [Advertisement](/advertisement/) in which I explain if, why and what kind of ads could be around here in the future.

Don't be scared or angry.

**Have a look!**
