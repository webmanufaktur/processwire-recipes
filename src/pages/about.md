Since `processwire-recipes.com` went down and never came back 😔 I decided to play around with all the ProcessWire Recipes and moved it over to a fresh new instance of 11ty running on Cloudflare Pages with a public Github Directory.

**Update: 2023-03-05**

We now have full access to the old/former Github account and repository. In the near future there will be a slight change in submitting new recipes and changes.

**Update: 2023-03-11**

[processwire.recipes](https://processwire.recipes/) is our new home now. While this is already awesome we will soon switch back to the [old official Github repo](https://github.com/processwire-recipes/Recipes) but with a new markdown format for upcoming recipes and updates.

See: [Forum announcement](https://processwire.com/talk/topic/7572-processwire-recipes/page/3/#comment-231247)

## ProcessWire Recipes Legacy (Github)

This project is based on the great work done [Marcus](https://marcus-herrmann.com/). As his project went offline some time ago I put it online again - in a different but similar way.

- https://github.com/processwire-recipes/Recipes

## ProcessWire Recipes 2023 (Github)

The new repository (based on the legacy version) can be found here.

- https://github.com/webmanufaktur/processwire-recipes

Some day in the future additional recipes will be added from my personal collection.
