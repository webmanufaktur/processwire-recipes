Since `processwire-recipes.com` went down and never came back üòî, I decided to have some fun with all the **ProcessWire Recipes**. I moved them over to a fresh new instance of **11ty** running on **Cloudflare Pages**, which is accessible from a public Github Directory.

## Google Pagespeed Performance

I was pleased with how the results looked at first, but I soon realized that they were outdated. Nowadays, there are more considerations to keep in mind, such as accessibility and best practices.

## Website Carbon Footprint

I also checked the website's carbon footprint, and I was pleasantly surprised by the results. It performed better than 98% of all pages that were tested, which made me feel really good about using a static site generator on an EDGE hosting provider.
